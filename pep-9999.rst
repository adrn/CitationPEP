TODO:
* Send your PEP submission to the PEP editors at peps@python.org

Formatting requirements (from PEP0012):
=======================================
* You must adhere to the Emacs convention of adding two spaces at the end of
every sentence.
* Fill your paragraphs to column 70, but under no circumstances should your
lines extend past column 79.
* You must use two blank lines between the last line of a section's body
and the next section heading
* When referencing an external web page in the body of a PEP, you should include
the title of the page in the text, with either an inline hyperlink reference to
the URL or a footnote reference
* If your PEP contains a diagram, you may include it in the processed
output using the "image" directive::

    .. image:: diagram.png

    ..
        Comment block for the image description.

* But, since this image will not be visible to readers of the PEP in source text
form, you should consider including a description or ASCII art alternative,
using a comment (below).
