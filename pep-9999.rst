TODO:
* Send your PEP submission to the PEP editors at peps@python.org

Formatting requirements (from PEP0012):
=======================================
* You must adhere to the Emacs convention of adding two spaces at the end of
every sentence.
* Fill your paragraphs to column 70, but under no circumstances should your
lines extend past column 79.
* You must use two blank lines between the last line of a section's body
and the next section heading
* When referencing an external web page in the body of a PEP, you should include
the title of the page in the text, with either an inline hyperlink reference to
the URL or a footnote reference
* If your PEP contains a diagram, you may include it in the processed
output using the "image" directive::

    .. image:: diagram.png

    ..
        Comment block for the image description.

* But, since this image will not be visible to readers of the PEP in source text
form, you should consider including a description or ASCII art alternative,
using a comment (below).

Abstract
========

This PEP proposes (1) a new, soft standard for packages to define their own
preferred manner of citation, and (2) a new builtin function to extract this
information. This functionality is motivated by the recent increase in support
for citing software in scientific journals, and the need to make citations more
visible to users.


Rationale
=========

Python has been adopted as a fundamental programming language in the scientific
community. As an example from astronomical journals, the figure below shows mentions to

.. image:: python-ads.png

..
    Figure showing the exponential increase of mentions of the word "Python" over time in the astronomical literature. Figure also shows the decline in number or constant number of mentions to other scripting languages Perl, Matlab, and IDL.

Key points:
- Show plot of Python mentions vs. time
- Scipy, numpy, astropy mentions vs. citations
- CITATION file in source not enough for scientists.
